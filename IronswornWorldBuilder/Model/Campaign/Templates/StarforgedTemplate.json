  "description" : "Our adventures are set within the Forge. This is a globular cluster in orbit around your people's home galaxy. It is 1,700 light years above the galactic planeâ€”a bright island in a dark void.\n\nVast clouds of interstellar nebula span the depths of the Forge, interspersed with denser clouds of vibrant interplanetary dust and strange energies. It is a chaotic galaxy wracked by fiery stellar storms and unpredictable gravitational currents. The planets and stars of this place are born of that chaos.\n\nYour people came to the Forge two centuries ago in the wake of a cataclysm in their home galaxy. Today, this new home offers opportunity and peril. Remnants of ancient civilizations hold dangerous knowledge and forbidden power. Your people build settlements on new worlds, but those places rarely offer a safe haven. Conflicts often rage between people and factions. Pirates prowl the spaceways in search of easy prey. Baneful creatures and dark forces dwell on corrupted planets and in the abyssal void between stars.",
